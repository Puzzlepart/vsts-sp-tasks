### Mayor changes

- Added a new task (preview) to the extension, wich allows to use PnP PowerShell inline or from a file without worrying about the correct module.
- PowerShell Modules for all SharePoint versions are now downloaded from the official [PSGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) and saved in the tools folder of the agent. If the module already exists, it is not downloaded again.
